# README

This application is used as a guide for those reading Brandon Sanderson's 'A Stormlight Archive' Series. In it's current form it is a proof of concept that creates a 3D map of the fictional world of Roshar. The application allows you to select the book and chapters from a dropdown menu and will generate a marker to where the main character of the chapter is focused. You are free to zoom in and out and explore the world in a way that makes it easier to follow along with the story.
